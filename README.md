# Linda-Overview

### OVERVIEW OF LINDA
This incredible challenge *inspired* us to push our boundaries using the knowledge we have acquired through the years and create **LINDA**


_WHAT IT DOES_:
Linda helps people manage their medical therapy and predict clinical worsening in a non-invasive manner.

_HOW WE BUILT IT_:
We built it by thinking about the underlying adherence problems and by coming up with effective solutions that could be used by patients of all ages.

_CHALLENGES WE RUN INTO_:
The main challenge was creating simple and easy to use features for the management of a complex and multifaceted medical issue without compromising too much on functionality.

_ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE ARE PROUD OF_:
One of the hardest things was choosing an initial direction for our project using the most solid and realiable scientific information available. It was a humbling experience but also an inspiring one: we understood that to accomplish something we had to start from the big picture, study and work hard to reach a specific issue that people absolutely needed to be solved. We are proud of this journey.

_WHAT WE LEARNED_:
We learned that effective teamwork can stem from a balance of friendship, drive and common vision. Creating an effective and honest team environment was the key that brought us to a productive and positive path.

_WHAT'S NEXT FOR LINDA_:
Linda is much more than a simple assistance tool for chronic heart failure patients: she can be the engine for many innovative ideas and breakthroughs obtained through advanced data analysis.
